# ShotTaker
Re-implementation of Sy Brand ShotTaker class for the purpose of learning C++ interfacing the FFmpeg C APIs.

This code is based on the code written by Sy Brand in youtube video "C++ GUIs with coroutines, WinUI3, C++/WinRT and FFMPEG" at around 28 minutes in (https://youtu.be/OSYXGyMw9GE?t=1636).

I have also used CMake project based on  youtube video "LIVESTREAM: Setting up FFmpeg and OpenGL in C++ for real-time video processing" by user Bartholomew that seems to go through ALL the steps required to configure and build a cross-platform app usign FFmpeg in C++ FROM SCRATCH (https://youtu.be/MEMzo59CPr8 ).
